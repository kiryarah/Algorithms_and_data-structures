# Algorithms_and_data-structures
My implementation of algorithms and data structures on Python. Leetcode solution etc.

Folder structure:
 - The "algorithms" folder contains my implementations of classical algorithms
 - In the folder "data_structures" there are realizations of a binary heap and a Bi-linked list
